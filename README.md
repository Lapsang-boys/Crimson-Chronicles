Desperate times calls for desperate measures. Our hope lies in the brilliance of inexperienced strategists leading the vanguard against the looming threats. 

In Ashenvale the Sentinels are drawing their last breath; Felwood spreads its corrpution in an unending invasion. Mysterious and mutated beasts alongside devilish satyrs welcome the Sentinels call for aid with renewed bloodlust. 

The moment has finally come to purge Stratholme once and for all! The Scarlet Crusade rallies all able-bodied men and women to aid them in a final assult on the Lost city. With the light radiating on our backs we will charge the horrors of The Scourge. Join us to end this nightmare that has haunted us for far too long!

Long gone empires wave their banner for supremacy once again when the Caverns of Time opens its portals. Only the most versatile strategists will stand a chance against the genius warlords from the distant pasts.
